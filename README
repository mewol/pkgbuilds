Simple repository for a few PKGBUILDs for Arch Linux, primarily for personal use.

Not guaranteed to work, look nice, or do anything else.

What's here? 

nwn-platinum: Neverwinter Nights (1), platinum edition release
nwn-cep: Community Expansion Pack for NWN
nwn-prc: Player Resource Something-that-begins-with "c" pack for NWN

xbmc-mew: XBMC copied almost entirely from the xbmc-git in the AUR. Since the maintainer for the AUR version feels compelled to update every day (triggering a rebuild with automated tools), this is my local copy.

git-glkterm: Git interactive fiction (glulx, inform) interpreter using the glkterm ncurses library. Nice and quick.
glulxe-glkterm-git: As above, but with glulxe, and git repository for both. Not as quick.
gargoyle-svn: svn checkout of gargoyle, GUI-based. Much quicker than last release.
fizmo-git: git version of fizmo (currently broken)
